According to \\(New \\space York \\space Post\\), in June 2022 the average rental price in Manhattan incredibly was \\(\\$5,058\\), unprecedented in NYC history. (https://nypost.com/article/where-nyc-real-estate-rental-market-stands-right-now-housing-prices/) Therefore, it is necessary to make statistics and research on the rental market data and summarize the market rules, so that tenants and landlords can better understand the market information and resource matching will be optimized, that’s the theme and significance of our research. To be specific, Our research project focuses on the rental data in NYC covering more than a decade till 2022. We plan to study how the rental prices has changed in recent years, with variation in locations, built years, house area and so on, to see the chronological and geographical trends and on the prices. In order to keep our theme accurate and professional, we mainly focus on the regular changes of housing prices and the impact of different housing sources on their housing prices. We find interesting results and rules by visualizing the datasets.

(https://nypost.com/article/where-nyc-real-estate-rental-market-stands-right-now-housing-prices/) We plan to study how the rental prices has changed in recent years, with variation in locations (boroughs, neighborhoods, etc.) to see the chronological and geographical trends and on the prices. Moreover, we plan to do research on the potential relationship between the prices and other factors, such as rental inventories, crime rate and occupancy/vacancy rate by different visualization tools in R together with assistance of other statistical tests. Overall we try to analyze which factor(s) have more or less influence on rental prices and if certain boroughs, neighborhoods put heavier pressure on people who try to live there. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 DOF Condominium Comparable Rental Income in NYC url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Condominium-Comparable-Rental-Income-in-NYC/9ck6-2jew This dataset contains the basic information of all apartments in New York, including geographic location information (coded by borough ID and priority ID) and house properties. Collected by The Department of Finance (DOF) through the investigation of apartment information, it is highly reliable and basically error free; Because it includes detailed address and house information, this dataset is very convenient for us to analyze the geographical distribution of rental prices; At the same time, according to the detailed geocoding, we can jointly analyze this dataset with other data to draw further conclusions.

According to the inspection, there are no missing items in the data column we use. 2.2.2 NYC crime url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYC-crime/qb7u-rbmr This dataset contains the overall crime information in New York this year. Collected by New York City Police Department (NYPD), it is also highly reliable(After all, it’s first-hand information); As it contains the position and other detailed information about the crimes, we can analyze the relationship between the crime rate and the rental fee in NYC. The data is stored in csv format, and we can use read.csv() to import directly. According to the inspection, there are no missing items in the data column we use. 2.2.3 School Locations url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-School-Locations/p6h4-mpyy This dataset contains the overall school information in New York this year. Collected by Department of Education (DOE), it is also highly reliable; As it contains the location and other detailed information(such as level, and average grades) about the schools, we can analyze the relationship between the school locations and the rental fee in NYC. The data is stored in xlsx format, and we can use read_excel() to import directly. According to the inspection, there are no missing items in the data column we use. 2.2.4 Median gross rent url:https://data.census.gov/cedsci/all?t=Housing&amp;g=0400000US36%248600000 This dataset contains different housing information in New York State provided by the United States Census Bureau(USCB). USCB is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System and is in charge of gathering information on the population and economy of the country. We filter the tables by geography to all 5-digit ZIP code tabulation area in New York State and find the topics we are interested in(e.g. median gross rent). We will process the table by choosing the ZIP code in New York City only to concentrate on our topic. Since a fraction of areas has missing data, we will use the available methods to fill. The dataset can be downloaded as csv file which can be easily imported by R. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources After refining our project target, we mainly use the following two data sources. 3.1.1 DOF Condominium Comparable Rental Income in NYC url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Condominium-Comparable-Rental-Income-in-NYC/9ck6-2jew This dataset is used by DOF(The Department of Finance) to value condominiums, which contains basic information of condominiums for rent in New York, including geographic location information (coded by borough ID and priority ID) and house properties. Collected by The Department of Finance (DOF) through the investigation of apartment information, it is highly reliable and basically error free; Because it includes detailed address and house information, this dataset is very convenient for us to analyze the geographical distribution of rental prices. The dataset contains 61 columns, but we only use a few of these. The used columns’ infomation: Boro-Block-Lot: Text variable. The Borough-Block-Lot location of the subject condominium. The lot identifies the condominium billing lot generally associated with the condominium management organization. Building Classification: Text variable(we transform it later). The Building Class code is used to describe a property’s use. This report includes the two character code as well as the description of the building class. Total Units: Number variable. Total number of units in the building Year Built: Text variable. The year the building was built Estimated Gross Income: Number variable. Estimated Income per SquareFoot * Gross SquareFoot Gross Income per SqFt: Number variable. Estimated income per squarefoot of median comparable Full Market Value Number variable. Current year’s total market value of the land and building 3.1.2 Housing:United States Census Bureau This data source contains different housing information in New York State provided by the United States Census Bureau(USCB). USCB is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System and is in charge of gathering information on the population and economy of the country. We filter the tables by geography and find the topics we are interested in. The dataset can be downloaded as csv or excel file which can be easily imported by R. All the tables from this source is not tidy, and the data type is character although it actually provides numerical information. We will transform it later. 3.1.2.1 Gross Rent url:https://data.census.gov/table?q=B250&amp;g=0600000US3600508510,3604710022,3606144919,3608160323,3608570915_1600000US3651000&amp;tid=ACSDT1Y2021.B25063 This table contains 1-Year Estimates of the rent of the occupied housing units in five boroughs in New York City.

The code is attached in the Results part. 3.2.2 Housing:United States Census Bureau The transformation of the data from USCB mainly concentrates on two parts: tidying data and type conversion. The problem of the data sets is the geographical labels are listed in the columns. We will use the function ‘pivot_longer’ to deal with it. And we will use the function ‘gsub’ to clean the data and change the character to numerical data type. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 DOF Condominium Comparable Rental Income in NYC ## Year.Built Market.Value.per.SqFt ## 108 3 ## Full.Market.Value Estimated.Expense ## 2 1 ## Expense.per.SqFt Boro.Block.Lot ## 1 0 ## Condo.Section Address ## 0 0 ## Neighborhood Building.Classification ## 0 0 ## Total.Units Gross.SqFt ## 0 0 ## Estimated.Gross.Income Gross.Income.per.SqFt ## 0 0 ## Net.Operating.Income county ## 0 0 ## house_type ## 0 According to the counts of missing values in each column, we can see that the majority of NAs are about when the building was built. As there are too many variables, we focus our analysis only on those with at least one missing value. ## county cnt.na n percent ## 1 bronx 1 1042 0.0009596929 ## 2 kings 97 9314 0.0104144299 ## 3 new york 2 12784 0.0001564456 ## 4 queens 2 5022 0.0003982477 ## 5 richmond 6 345 0.0173913043 As there are more than 20,000 rows of data, most of the rows are complete cases. Among the variables we care about, Year.Built is the only one that has several missing values. Thus, we perform analysis on the missing pattern between this variable and the county the building belongs to. We find that Richmond County (Staten Island Borough) has the largest percentage of missing values and also the least number of buildings in our analysis. 3.3.2 Housing:United States Census Bureau According to the counts of missing values for each table, none of them has missing values in any column. Take the table about the median gross rent by year householder moved into unit for example, we can draw a missing data plot. Because the type of variables from USCB is character, we may need further analysis to see if there are missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results From the ridgeline plots of the gross income per square feet in five counties of NYC, we can see that they all roughly follow a normal distribution (with Queens having a little more deviation). New York has the largest median value about 40/\\(ft^2\\) and the widest spread. For the rest 4 counties, their median values are close to each other. The values for richmond is more densely distributed. From the ridgeline plots of the gross income per square feet in 4 building classes of NYC, we can see that they all have similar price range and roughly follow a left-skewed distribution. The distribution of R9 class is a little special. It roughly follows a bimodal distribution. ## Year.Built Market.Value.per.SqFt ## 108 3 ## Full.Market.Value Estimated.Expense ## 2 1 ## Expense.per.SqFt Boro.Block.Lot ## 1 0 ## Condo.Section Address ## 0 0 ## Neighborhood Building.Classification ## 0 0 ## Total.Units Gross.SqFt ## 0 0 ## Estimated.Gross.Income Gross.Income.per.SqFt ## 0 0 ## Net.Operating.Income county ## 0 0 ## house_type ## 0 According to the counts of missing values in each column, we can see that the majority of NAs are about when the building was built. As there are too many variables, we focus our analysis only on those with at least one missing value. In this plot it seems that the gross income averaged on area is independent from the year the building was established. However when we separate the calculation based on different counties, we obtain the following graphs. Plot For all the five counties, we can see a increasing trend in the gross income per \\(ft^2\\) versus the year when the building was built after around 1970s, and the slope becomes more obvious in recent 20 years. Except for Richmond County, the curves for the other 4 counties first went downward before 1970s. The average gross income for Bronx County and Richmond County varies slightly regarding the establishing year while it changes relatively a lot for the other 3 counties. This mosaic plot shows the proportion of different housing types in different regions. This reveals the popularity of different room types, and combined with other visual analysis, we can further analyze the impact of room types on rental. This histogram shows the the gross rent for different boroughs using 1-year estimate in 2021. The distributions of the rent in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island are approximately distributed and most of values fall in the range ‘$1,500 to $1,999’. The distribution for Bronx is left skewed. Most of housing units in Manhattan have the rent price higher than 3500 dollars. We also notice the size of data for Staten Island is smaller than other boroughs, which means its rental market is less buoyant than elsewhere. This line chart shows the median gross rent for different boroughs. Because we use the 5-year estimate, the trends are very pronounced. The gross rent has been rising steadily in the past five years. The increasing rates are very similar among different boroughs. The line for Brooklyn is closet to the line for NYC. The order of the median gross rent from high to low is: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Bronx for all the years. This stacked bar plot shows the number of vacant housing units and their vacant status in different boroughs in 2021. Manhattan has the most vacant housing units, and the status ‘For rent’ and ‘For seasonal,recreational,or occasional use’ make up the most of them. The underlying reason might be the impact of epidemic, which prevent people from renting housing units in Manhattan since its has the highest price over all the boroughs. While for the other four boroughs, other types of vacancy make up the largest proportion. We can further analyze the reason of this kind of vacancy structure. This plot uses the year householder moved in as its facet. From this plot, the median gross rent has been increasing with the time the householder moved in. We know that some buildings will maintain a close rental price when the residents renew the tenancy agreement. The gaps among the median gross rent can reflect the change of the rental marketing market over time. It is obvious that the median gross rent increased the most for housing units in Manhattan. We can further analyze the data by investigating what happened in the time period between 2014-2018. Two inputs are needed to build a choropleth map: A geospatial object providing region boundaries and a numeric variable that we use to color each geographical unit. We use the geoJSON format which provides the ZIP code boundaries in New Yor City and the median gross rent of housing units per code. We transform the geospatial object to a data frame using the tidy function of the broom library and bind it with the numeric data. For the regions without corresponding value, they will be filled in color grey in the map. From this choropleth map, we can notice that the overall situation of the rent in the five boroughs correspond with what we have analyzed for other plots. According to the distribution of the color, the order of rental price from high to low is: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Bronx. To be more specific, the median gross rents in Lower Manhattan and Midtown Manhattan are significantly higher than other regions. The rent in the area near the River Easter is much higher than its average in Brooklyn. Although not far from midtown Manhattan, the regions near the boarder between Manhattan and Bronx has relatively low value for the median gross rent. This map can be used to connect with other index such as crime rate to do deeper analysis of the cause of different rental price.

We cleaned, transformed and analyzed the missing value patterns of the datasets used. In terms of content, we explored the relationship between housing prices and regions, housing types, and built year through appropriate visualization of different types of data; In addition, we also explored the correlation between different factors. However, we have to admit there are some limitations in our current work. Due to the high commercial value of rental data. It is difficult to collect a large amount of reliable data. Besides, we only focused on the the influence of room properties on itself, and didn’t consider the impact of location(which is related with crime rate, school entrance rate and so on) and policies on housing prices, which made our analysis incomplete. So, for these limitations, we expect to conduct some more in-depth analysis, including the impact of various external factors on house prices, as well as the time series characteristics of house prices, etc. In addition, we will continue to strive to collect more and more extensive relevant data, to enhance the persuasiveness of the results. Through the project, we practiced the theoretical knowledge we have learned, which has consolidated our grasp of these knowledge. At the same time, we have also gained some experience in dealing with problems in actual analysis, helping us to better visualize and analyze problems in various situations. Finally, this project makes us realize the importance of visualization in practical work, we expect to further study the visualization methods in later work and study.
