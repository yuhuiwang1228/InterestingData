Our research project focuses on the rental data in NYC covering more than a decade till 2022. Rental is always a heated topic in NYC, which is a metropolis with the largest city population exceeding 8 million. According to $New \space York \space Post$, in June 2022 the average rental price in Manhattan incredibly was $\$5,058$, unprecedented in NYC history. (https://nypost.com/article/where-nyc-real-estate-rental-market-stands-right-now-housing-prices/)  We plan to study how the rental prices has changed in recent years, with variation in locations (boroughs, neighborhoods, etc.) to see the chronological and geographical trends and on the prices. Moreover, we plan to do research on the potential relationship between the prices and other factors, such as rental inventories, crime rate and occupancy/vacancy rate by different visualization tools in R together with assistance of other statistical tests. Overall we try to analyze which factor(s) have more or less influence on rental prices and if certain boroughs, neighborhoods put heavier pressure on people who try to live there.
